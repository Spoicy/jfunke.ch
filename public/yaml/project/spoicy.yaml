    - "This website is my own mini-project haven, where I build ideas I have for programming with a very minimalistic layout. It's all about coding here, stunning design is not a priority for any of these mini-projects."
    - "The projects here are mainly PHP, with a few JavaScript ones sprinkled throughout. You can read my blog below, where I document my various projects and the successes/struggles that come with coding them."
