    - "The very same website that you're viewing this entry from. I made this website completely from scratch using the Laravel framework using modern practices. Every developer needs their own webpage, and my goal was to go above and beyond as a technical showcase."
    - "Each page template is made up of multiple, smaller templates which consist of blocks and components. This way, a backend can be easily made to edit layouts, where only data needs to be passed through in order to display the entire layout. A completely overkill solution for such a basic website, but if there's any website I'm going to overengineer, it's my own."
