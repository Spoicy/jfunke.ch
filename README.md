This website is made with the Laravel Framework. The goal is to a have a professional looking website for potential employers and other interested people to look at. The structure of the pages/templates used to create the website is based loosely off of the Atomic Design Methodology, where the principle is to break each element down to their core components, in order to establish a hierarchy of "building blocks" that make web design a lot easier in exchange for more upfront effort.
